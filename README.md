Hadoop-YARN-Dynamic-container
=============================

This is a project to implement elastic container usage on hadoop yarn for long running jobs, so that they can make better use the cluster resources.

For hadoop src, I made a patch HADOOP-10110.patch so that some errors in the test folders can be resolved.

To build the project, see hadoop-2.2.0-src/BUILDING.txt.
For hadoop original readme and license info, see hadoop-2.2.0-src/README.txt and hadoop-2.2.0-src/LICENSE.txt.

Come on! I'll begin to develop now!
